# Images Directory

This directory contains images used throughout the IronGate University website.

## Current Setup

The website currently uses placeholder images from Unsplash Source. These are high-quality, free-to-use images that can be easily replaced with your own images.

## Replacing Images

To replace placeholder images with your own:

1. **Save your images** in this `images/` directory
2. **Update HTML files** - Replace the Unsplash URLs with local paths:
   - Change: `src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-..."`
   - To: `src="images/your-image-name.jpg"`

## Image Recommendations

- **Format**: JPG or PNG

  - Hero images: 1920x1080px
